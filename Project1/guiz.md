1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?


2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?


3. What's wrong with this code:
```
const page = (
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
)
```


4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?


5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?
