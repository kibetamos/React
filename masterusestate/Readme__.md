INTRODUCTION
Successful front-end web developers must be able to structure content in HTML and present visual representation of the structure for various devices using CSS and JavaScript. Prior to building a website, designers and developers create page layouts to guide the development.

In this task, you will demonstrate your ability to design a layout for an interactive website about a U.S. state of your choice. In Task 2, you will develop the content of this website, including demographic, economic, and geographic information about the state capital and two other cities in the state.
SCENARIO
You have a job interview for an entry-level position on the web development team for a state government office. After inquiring about your education, skills, and experience, the hiring manager has asked you to create a page layout as part of the interview process. If you are hired, you will use this page layout to fully develop a new website for the state government office.
REQUIREMENTS
Your submission must be your original work. No more than a combined total of 30% of a submission and no more than a 10% match to any one individual source can be directly quoted or closely paraphrased from sources, even if cited correctly. An originality report is provided when you submit your task that can be used as a guide.



You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.



Tasks may not be submitted as cloud links, such as links to Google Docs, Google Slides, OneDrive, etc., unless specified in the task requirements. All other submissions must be file types that are uploaded and submitted as attachments (e.g., .docx, .pdf, .ppt).



A.  Create two low-level comprehensive page layouts that can be used to develop a 4–10-page website related to a U.S. state. The first layout should introduce the state (i.e., the main page) and the second layout should be for individual city pages (i.e., the state capital and two additional cities in the state).
3
1. Include clearly denoted placeholders for each of the following semantic elements for each page of the website:

•   a header containing introductory content (pertaining to the document as a whole or a particular section of a document)

•   a nav to place the links that allow users to navigate the site

•   a section to display the main content of the page

•   an aside to display information related to the content


Note: The low-level comprehensive page layout of your main elements for the cities will remain the same on each page, but you will customize the content on each of the pages in the next task. Realistically most sites will have several different templates for different types of pages. You are only being asked to create two pages for this task.


Note: You can use any tool to create the low-level comprehensive layout, such as graphic creation or manipulation software, presentation software, word processing software, or another tool of your choice.


B.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.

INTRODUCTION
To be successful as a front-end web designer or developer, you must be able to structure content in HTML and present a visual representation of the structure for various devices using CSS and JavaScript. In this task, you will further design, develop, and implement the low-level comprehensive page layout you created in the previous task. Your work for Task 2 will not be evaluated until Task 1 has been submitted and passed.

In this task, you will have the opportunity to demonstrate your HTML and CSS skills as well as your ability to implement user-centered solutions by creating a website about one of the states within the United States. As you create your website, you will use an external style sheet for the design and layout of the site. Each page should have the same layout to maintain a consistent user experience throughout the site. You will publish your website to one of the free hosting sites listed in the Web Links section.

Note: Because your site will be live, use caution with the content and images you include on your website. The public will have access to your website, so do not include any sensitive or private information.

Note: All the code in your submission must be original work. You may not use premade templates of any sort, including the templates provided in the exercise files of the course, blog software such as Blogger and WordPress, content management systems like Joomla! and PHP-Nuke, GUI web design software like Adobe Dreamweaver, or any type of “WYSIWYG” application that produces the code by clicking a button.
