Challenge: Think critically - how would you pass in a prop that wasn't
a string datatype.

E.g. Say you want each Joke component to receive an "upvotes" and "downvotes"
prop that is a number, as well as a prop with an array of comments, and a boolean
of whether the joke is a pun (`isPun`).

Challenge: turn the strings in the array into <h3> elements instead
